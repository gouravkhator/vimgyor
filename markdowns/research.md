# Research Done or To Be Done

## Research to be Done

- Research if `execute!` macro is better than `queue!` macro or not, in terms of operations time taken.
  - `execute!` macro does flushing out the commands output one at a time..
  - `queue!` macro only adds the commands output to the stdout, and only flushes when `Enter` key is pressed, or when we do `stdout().flush()` ourselves programmatically.
